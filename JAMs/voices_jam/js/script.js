/**
 * Speech Pictionary
 * Andr√© Neder
 * 
 * The Speech Pictionary is my attempt to replicate the game Pictionary with P5 and P5 Speech.
 * The whole game is divided in two states: home and card. When the user is in "home" the speech recognizer allows
 * for a category to be chosen. There are three categories: Object, Person/Place/Animal and Movie, and an All Play
 * category that picks a random card from all the other three.
 * My approach to make the drawings was to draw them with a pen on an iPad and record it. The video is them cropped
 * trimmed, and exported in webm format. The createVideo function is used to display it.
 * The user has one minute to guess the drawing, the videos finish with between 30 and 40 seconds.
 * The code for the title colors was based on this thread answer by Rabbid76: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52614829/p5-js-change-text-color-in-for-a-single-word-in-a-sentence
 *
