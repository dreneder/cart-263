# Speech Pictionary

The Speech Pictionary uses the P5 and P5 Speech libraries to give users the opportunity to play the classic Pictionary game with the computer using nothing but voice commands.
The program is always listening, so to pick a card, just say the category desired and to guess the drawing just say what you think it is, or just say "return to home" if you wish to pick another card. There is a slight delay for voice capture which is part of the voice processing of the library.
