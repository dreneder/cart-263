# Metropolitan

Metropolitan is rather a simulation and an experiment than a game. Its' aim is to simulate a 3D
environtment of a tunnel using 2D sprites. The only controls available are a lever for speed and
an emergency button. There are speed, direction and power indicators on the cockpit dash.
The tunnel animation is mapped to the path in the center console and it actually follows it.

# How to Play:

Lever: Controls the torque and speed of the train. At the center level, the power is at 0.
By moving it up or down, the speed will increase and the train will move forwards or backwards.
Moving it closer to the center will also slow the speed.

Stop Button (!): Will move the lever to the center and stop the train.
