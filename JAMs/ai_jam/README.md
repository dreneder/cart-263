# Speech PictionAIry

The Speech PictionAIry uses my previous game that used the P5 and P5 Speech libraries and expands on the idea of playing a drawing game with the computer. In addition to using voice commands, now the users can also draw on a board and the ML5 library will use itsâ€™ directory to classify the doodles. P5 Speech is used to say what the machine is guessing.
The old game was made into another two states and the new one into one, totally controlled by the mouse buttons. The brush had to be made thick in order for it to work.
