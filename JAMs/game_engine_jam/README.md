# Invade Spacers

Contrary to Space Invaders, this game lets the player resist the destruction of the armada and invade the planet. This is an attempt to give the player the experience of playing the other side of the classic game.
Instead of destroying the enemy ship, hitting it with a bullet will only stun it. The player can shoot with any ship and even with all at once, but there is a cooldown of three sescods per invader to shoot. To win, at least one invader must pass the enemy ship, and the player looses when all invaders are destroyed.

# How to Play:

Start: Launch the game by pressing the spacebar to begin.
Controls: Use the arrow keys to move the invaders left and right. Press number keys to shoot bullets according to the column of invaders.
Objective: Shoot down invading aliens while avoiding their projectiles.
Scoring: Earn points for each alien destroyed. Try to achieve the highest score possible.
Game Over: The game ends when the player's spaceship is hit by an alien projectile.
