/**
 * Speech PictionAIry
 * Andr√© Neder
 * 
 * The Speech PictionAIry is the first time I do a sequel to another program for CART, it follows the game Speech Pictionary that used P5 Speech.
 * The game expands from the previous one and is divided in four states: home, draw, guess and card.
 * When the user is in "home" the user can choose whether to draw or guess a card, or random.
 * When in "guess", the user has to choose a category: Object, Person/Place/Animal, Movie, and All Play (random from the other three).
 * Like in the previous game "card" is used as a state for guessing the card.
 * In the "draw" state, the user is given a random card from a random category to draw. The timer works the same for the computer as for the user guessing.
 * If the the user guesses the right drawing, it's a win because it's a good guess. If the computer guesses the drawing, it's also a win because it was a
 * nice drawing, so it's a win-win lose-lose game :).
 * The code for the title colors was based on this thread answer by Rabbid76: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52614829/p5-js-change-text-color-in-for-a-single-word-in-a-sentence
 * The code for the confetti was addapted from slow_izzm's code: https://editor.p5js.org/slow_izzm/sketches/H1fhGJSaX
 * The code for the drawing was adapted from the sketch by Daniel Shiffman: https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/6LLnGY1VY
